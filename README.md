# AI tools used

Deepseek - To generate the initial codebase and assist in structuring the project.
Chatgpt - To generate code snippets, debugging, and optimizing the codebase.
workik - To generate mock data and information for therapists

# APIs

Used REST apis from the dotnet backend
Implement search functionality for therapists based on filters like specialty, and availability.
Handle booking and payment processes.

# Approach

Project Breakdown:

Divided the project into two core features:

1. Fetching Therapist Data: Displaying therapist profiles and availability.
2. Search Functionality: Allowing users to search for therapists based on specific criteria.

Extended the flow to include booking and payment processes.

Development Process:

1. Used AI tools (Deepseek and ChatGPT) to generate and optimize the codebase.
2. Leveraged Workik to create realistic mock data for therapists.
3. Integrated REST APIs for data fetching, search, and booking functionalities.

# Shortcuts or assumptions

Video conferencing and link generation were assumed to be complex and time-consuming.
For the prototype, video conferencing links were simulated and included in the downloadable invoice/report.
