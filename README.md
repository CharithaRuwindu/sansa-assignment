# AI tools used

Deepseek - Generate codebase
Chatgpt - Generate codebase
workik - To generate mock data and information for therapists

# APIs

used REST apis from the dotnet backend, for fetching therapists data and search functionality

# Approach

First, I broke down the project into parts. Got two main features sorted out (Fetching and searching)
Then created the process flow around it (Booking and payments). Carried on developing it with support of the AIs.

# Shortcuts or assumptions

The video conferencing and link generation are complex functions to be built and it takes time.
I assumed the links are generated individually for users and added it to the downloadable invoice / report.
